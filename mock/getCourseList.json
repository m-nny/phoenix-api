This course aims to provide the CS students with the necessary background and guidance in order to have them practically apply their CS and AI knowledge in financial domains. The course consists of 4 parts: In the first part of the course, all necessary financial background will be provided. In the second part, tangible mechanics of the domain (like the Financial Information Exchange, FIX, protocol, and order book dynamics) will be covered. In the third part, algorithmic side of the financial transactions will be elaborated on. And in the last part, quantitative strategies (like portfolio construction, high-frequency trading, news handling, etc.) which make heavy use of statistics, AI, data mining, time series analysis, and performance evaluations will be covered.",

This course aims to provide the CS students with the necessary background and guidance in order to have them practically apply their CS and AI knowledge in financial domains. The course consists of 4 parts: In the first part of the course, all necessary financial background will be provided. In the second part, tangible mechanics of the domain (like the Financial Information Exchange, FIX, protocol, and order book dynamics) will be covered. In the third part, algorithmic side of the financial transactions will be elaborated on. And in the last part, quantitative strategies (like portfolio construction, high-frequency trading, news handling, etc.) which make heavy use of statistics, AI, data mining, time series analysis, and performance evaluations will be covered.",

      "description": "The world’s electricity systems face a number of challenges, including ageing infrastructure, continued growth in demand, the integration of increasing numbers of variable renewable energy sources and electric vehicles, the need to improve the security of supply and the need to lower carbon emissions. Smart grid technologies offer ways not just to meet these challenges but also to develop a cleaner energy supply that is more energy efficient, more affordable and more sustainable. These challenges must also be addressed with regard to each region’s unique technical, financial and commercial regulatory environment. Given the highly regulated nature of the electricity system, proponents of smart grids must ensure that they engage with all stakeholders, including equipment manufacturers, system operators, consumer advocates and consumers, to develop tailored technical, financial and regulatory solutions that enable the potential of smart grids.\n\nMaking a city “smart” is emerging as a strategy to mitigate the problems generated by the urban population growth and rapid urbanization. More than half of the world’s population now lives in urban areas. This shift from a primarily rural to a primarily urban population is projected to continue. Cities, megacities, generate new kinds of problems. Difficulty in waste management, scarcity of resources, air pollution, human health concerns, traffic congestions, and inadequate, deteriorating and aging infrastructures are among the more basic technical, physical, and material problems. The urgency around these challenges is triggering many cities around the world to find smarter ways to manage them. These cities are increasingly described with the label ‘smart city’ which basically is a city that monitors and integrates conditions of all of its critical infrastructures, including roads, bridges, tunnels, rails, subways, airports, seaports, communications, water, power, even major buildings, to better optimize its resources, plan its preventive maintenance activities, and monitor all security aspects while maximizing services to its citizens.\n",

We will compare, and contrast, the history of two regions in different parts of the world, but with some similarities as well as differences in their histories. \nWe will study the transformation of the steppes of Eurasia and Great Plains of North America between the 16th and 20th centuries. Large parts of these grasslands and the lives of their inhabitants  -- steppe nomads, such as Kazakhs, and Plains Indians, for example the Sioux -- were changed forever. Their lands were conquered and annexed by larger states: the Russian Empire, later the Soviet Union, and United States of America. \nThe Russian and American states sponsored scientific studies of these lands, encouraged outsiders to settle or colonize them, and suppressed resistance. The settlers supported themselves partly by plowing up the land and growing crops. Their agricultural way of life partly replaced that of the native peoples who had relied more heavily on herding and hunting animals. The settlers reaped large harvests in good years, when the rains came, but experienced crises in years of drought. From the late nineteenth century there were attempts to develop more sustainable ways of farming and to conserve samples of the former natural environment of the grasslands. The changing ways of life in the grasslands were reflected in the cultures of the two societies.",

Characteristics and major changes in health care delivery systems (local and national) are discussed. Components of professional nursing values and core practice competencies are presented. The concept of an evidence-based approach to clinical practice is introduced. The nursing process is introduced and critical thinking strategies are outlined in the context of the nursing process.
